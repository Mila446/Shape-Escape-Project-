Project Name: Space Escape

Description:
My game is inspired by the iconic mobile game Geometry Dash. 
The user will be able to press keys on their respective keyboard (up) that 
will correspond to the movement of the “block”. As the user successfully 
progresses throughout the game, the level they are on will increase. 
This corresponded to the speed of the game increasing.  
This game will feature some of the unique features that the actual games has 
such as teleportation and “rocket-ship mode”. The player has 3 lives in the game 
and when down to 1 life, can redeem 1 life back by capturing a star that is 
displayed on the screen. The player can also claim the "ghost" (when down to 1 life)
which gives them the ability to glide through 3 obstacles without having to jump.

How to run project?

How to play game?
Successfully make it to level 5 by dodging obstacles. To help with this, capture
the star (which gives the player an extra life) or the ghost (which gives the 
player invinsibility for exactly 3 obstacles)

Shortcut Commands:
To check to see how the star and ghost abilities work, press the "t" key to
jump to level 2.
